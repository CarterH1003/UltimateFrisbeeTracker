# UltimateFrisbeeTracker

## ProjectGoal
The goal of the project is to use one camera angle to record the rotation of a frisbee throughout time. Ideally you will be able to see the rotation speed during each frame and the total number of rotations.

## Structure of the Repository
As of now there are two branches other than main in the repository.
Resources: Contains images demonstrating frisbee manipulation for tracking purposes and other resources used.
Testing: Contains testing videos and code for experimentation.

## Current State of the Project
Currently the frisbee is able to be isolated and tracked. The code for calculating the rotatioin is still being worked on.
